## CovidZones

CovidZones is a web app made with React which shows state and district wise COVID-19 stats. It displays district wise zonal data with a very simple and clean view. You can also check if you are in a containment zone by clicking on locate me button or simply searching your area in the search bar.

I have used open-source APIs from **covid19India** and **GeoIq** to collect data. This web app is meant to be used for personal use to get a quick overview of the district-wise zone and containment zones

The backend is made with Node.js and Express.js
